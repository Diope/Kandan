# Kandan

Kandan is a small news feed style app that utilizes Google translate APIs to make it a news feed anyone
use and enjoy. This is a work in progress.

# Current Progress
* Have implemented authorization/authentication, have yet to style and incorporate it into the app
* Currently working on getting a simplistic search on the index page that allows users to search for posts...not sure how that's going to play with the translate service.
* Simplistic interface created utilizing Bootstrap

# Stack being utilized
* Postgresql
* Minitest for test (guard, minitest, backtrace)
* Bcrypt for password_digest (cost is set to normal for both development and production)
* Standard Rails 4 fixtures
